<h3><a href="chickenlittle.jpg"><img src="thm_chickenlittle.gif" width="200" height="200" alt="" border="0" align=right hspace=8></a>Story mode</h3>

<p>In story mode you play as Chicken Little as she ventures across the kingdom on her quest to find the King. On her way, she encounters several characters, some who believe her story of the falling sky, others who think she's crazy, and those who just want her for dinner.

<p>Before each match, there's a cutscene. The great majority of these are going to be kept short and sweet. Each encounter will be followed by a game against that character's AI. As you play up the ladder, each character will have a slightly different AI, generally providing a greater challenge.

<p>After level 1, Chicken Little has convinced her Mom that something's wrong, so they decide to go tell the king what's shakin'. They pile into the station wagon, which pulls up at the beginning of each cutscene. After every level, a character is added to the car - some riding inside, some on top, some riding behind - in a funky little caravan. By the end of the game, it should look pretty funny.

<h4><a href="hennypenny.jpg"><img src="thm_hennypenny.gif" width="200" height="200" alt="" border="0" align=right hspace=8></a>Prologue</h4>

<p>[a grassy plain] Amidst the tall wisps of grass grows an old gnarled elm tree. The outline of a young girl can be seen reclined against that old tree. Multi-colored leaves fall gently to the ground as a suggestive breeze curls through the branches. In the distance, the silhouette of a farmhouse can barely be seen.

<p>[zoom in] Chicken Little lies leisurely against the tree, her spot. In her hands is a novel, its cover sporting a four-winged dragon rearing it's head. Scattered amongst the fallen leaves are several other novels. Fantasy, SciFi. The kid has an imagination.

<p>A deep, almost inaudible rumbling can be heard, like the purring of a sleeping lion. Little looks up, staring off at the horizon, letting the book fall to her lap. Louder, the thunder rolls in. A flash of lightning dots the horizon now and again.

<p>"Well," she sighs, "looks like a storm's on her way in." She glances down at her books, sees a few newly formed dark circles on them, fresh tattoos from a few lonely raindrops.

<p>"Looks like she's already here." Little stands up, collecting her novels. She stretches her well-rested legs, then begins to head for the farmhouse in the distance.

<p>"Better get home before mom throws a fit."

<p>A sudden gust of wind nearly knocks her off her feet. She catches herself, looking back at the horizon. The lightning seems a lot closer than it was before, the sky a lot darker. To the east, it's almost pitch black. She stares into the dark mass for a few more moments, then sees it as another lightning snakes up - not down - the sky. Three tornadoes, dancing amongst one another.

<p>"Mom!" she yells, sprinting for the house. She clutches her novels tighter. She's gone not more than a few feet when an ear-splitting burst of thunder literally shakes the ground. She trips, rolling onto her back in the grass.

<p>Then she sees.

<p>Purple lightning streaks overhead, and the clouds... the clouds are spiraling down the sky, rushing towards her.

<p>She stands up, letting her books fall to the ground. She doesn't blink, her mouth hangs open.

<p>The sky is falling.

<h4><a href="burlybunny.jpg"><img src="thm_burlybunny.gif" width="200" height="200" alt="" border="0" align=right hspace=8></a>Level 3 - Burly Bunny</h4>

<p>Henny's station wagon breaks down on a stretch of empty road. Burly Bunny, one buff towtruck driver, happens by. If you win, he gives you a tow to the city to see the king.

<br clear=all>

<h4><a href="turkeylurkey.jpg"><img src="thm_turkeylurkey.gif" width="200" height="213" alt="" border="0" align=right hspace=8></a>Level 4 - Turkey Lurkey</h4>

<p>Burly's truck, Henny's car in tow, pulls up to the edge of the city, where turkey happens to be hanging out. CL knows turkey, and tries to warn him of the impending doom. Turkey
thinks she's confused. Beat him to convince him.

<br clear=all>

<h4><img src="theking.jpg" width="200" height="184" alt="" border="0" align=right hspace=8>Level 5 - Foxy Loxy</h4>

<p>The group, now at the castle, bursts into the darkened throne room to find a shadowy figure leisurely slouched in the king's chair. the figure leans into the light, revealing himself to be foxy,
and gestures to the meal layed out on the table before him - including a roasted chicken, wearing the crown. Beat foxy and he runs away.

<br clear=all>

<h4><a href="duckylucky.jpg"><img src="thm_duckylucky.gif" width="200" height="200" alt="" border="0" align=right hspace=8></a>Level 6 - Ducky Lucky</h4>

<p>The heroes chase foxy to the docks, where he hops into a speedboat and zooms off. luckily, a certain duck happens to be docked nearby. Captain ducky doesn't seem in too much a hurry to <i>chase</i> a fox. Beat him to convince him to help.

<br clear=all>

<h4><a href="foxyloxy.jpg"><img src="thm_foxyloxy.gif" width="200" height="200" alt="" border="0" align=right hspace=8></a>Level 7 - Foxy Loxy Round 2</h4>

With ducky's help, the heroes chase foxy down on the high seas. Beat foxy, and you arrive at his destination - a secret island. Lose, and he gets away.

<br clear=all>

<h4>Level 8 - Bolt</h4>

<p>As soon as our heroes step foot upon the island, they encounter a large gate. A dull voice informs them that they are trespassing, and are to be eliminated. Out steps bolt, whom you must fight 
for your life.

<h4>Level 9 - The King</h4>

Final showdown with the king, who is very much alive, and...well...we wouldn't want to spoil <i>every</i> surprise, would we?
