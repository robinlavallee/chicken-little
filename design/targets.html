<h3>Targets</h3>

<h4>Gamedev.net contest</h4>

<p>We will complete an alpha version of our game for the <A HREF="http://gamedev.net/community/contest/contest3.asp" class="external">Gamedev.net compo</A>. This will help create a schedule for us, and maybe provide us with some cooL prizes.

<p>Only 3 people can be submitted with our entry, and only three prizes will be awarded if we win. Though Kevin seems to be okay with additional people working on the project (I will go without a prize if we win - n8).

<p>August 27, 2000 : Draft design document done.<br>
October 7, 2000 : Alpha 1 and final design document submitted.

<p>The alpha version should not be distributed beyond the gamedev.net site and should have a timeout mechanism (November 15, 2000).

<p>Future versions will be available from gratisgames.com - we will ask that those trying alpha/beta versions submit any bugs they find. Each version will expire - we must release an updated version before the prior expires.
