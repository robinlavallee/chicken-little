<h3>Twit list</h3>

<p>This is where all the ideas go that aren't going to be in the game. This serves two purposes. Any ideas we feel strongly against are listed here with reasons why we aren't implementing them. This prevents us from picking up the idea later on and wasting time discussing it, from this list we'll see that we already agreed to ditch the idea. 

<p>It also provides a list of ideas that might be used for a sequel or maybe even looked at again before the first revision is done. These are ideas that don't seem to fit right now, but could be improved upon later and add something to the game.

<h4>Game pieces</h4>

<p>Big eggs, little eggs. Big eggs that take up the space of four.

<p>Varying configurations of eggs. Not just the standard two eggs at a time, eggs could fall as single eggs anywhere up to half-dozen groupings. Scattered groupings where the piece has open spaces in it.

<h4>In-game characters</h4>

<p>Putting the characters in the game, in a slightly similar fashion to Dr. Mario which has viruses that you must remove by creating a match around them. Seeing that giant eggs take up a rectangular region, it might actually work well to have little characters running around. We're looking at something around 30 x 40 pixels which isn't large, but a similar size to the smallish <a href="http://www.jazzjackrabbit.com/photos.htm" class="external">Jazz Jackrabbit 2</a> sprites. 

<p>Besides running around the bottom of the screen, the characters could be affected or have an affect on the falling game pieces (and hatchlings). If you drop an egg on a character, they might jump out of the way or hold it up. They might even walk around with the object. Too much weight could squish the character in a cartoon fashion. And it would be up to you to prevent foxy from eating your friends by splitting them apart. Trapping them together would be uhh, bad (foxy swallows your friend whole). This could translate to a lot of frames of nifty animation, which would be pretty cooL but a lot of work.

<h4>Layered backgrounds</h4>

<p>Foreground, background layers... including the possibility of an animated sky. 

<p>Adds lots of work, background covered up by game pieces anyway. Constant animation could get in the way of the game play.

<h4>Obstacles</h4>

<p>Rather than a tree in the background, the tree could 'interfere' with the game play such that eggs rest on the tree rather than falling to the ground. The tree would likely exist outside of the playing area and just a branch would be an obstacle. There could also be an egg (game pieces) in the nest at the start. See <A HREF="http://www.metro3d.com/products/puzzle_master.html" class=external>Puzzle Master</a>.

<p>Areas that interfere with the game play should be brightly colored just like outside of the playing field. Parts of the image that are just in the background are darkened slightly.
