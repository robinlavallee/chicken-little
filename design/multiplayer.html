<h3>Head-to-Head</h3>

<p>Play against a friend or the computer. You can pick any one of the characters and play a variety of game rules and options.

<p>Multi-player can be played on the same system using a combination of a keyboard and gamepad/joystick, or with two joysticks. Split keyboard play may also be supported.

<p>TCP support will allow one player to host and another to join. The hosting player sets the options for the game. Play can be over the local LAN or the Internet. After completing a round, additional games can be started without disconnecting/reconnecting. No plans to support serial (direct link) or modem-to-modem play at this time.
